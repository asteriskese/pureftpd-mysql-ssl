#VIRTUAL HOSTING WITH PUREFTPD + MYSQL AUTHENTICATION + TLS/SSL + QUOTA AND BANDWIDTH MANAGEMENT
(Environment: CentOS-6.6-x86_64-minimal.iso)

+This document describes how to install a PureFTPd server that uses virtual users from a MySQL database instead of real system users. 

+This is much more performance and allows to have thousands of ftp users on a single machine. 

+In addition to that I will show the use of quota and upload/download bandwidth limits with this setup. 

+Passwords will be stored encrypted as MD5 strings in the database.
